# ChaiCode Assignment UI
---

Two projects of **Cursor** & **Mintlify** were assigned to all the students of the cohort and we were supposed to deliver a UI clone built using vanilla CSS and no frameworks of any kind. I have provided code files and ScreenShots of the webpages. However, I have abstained from uploading all the images and other such required assets as they would simply bloat the project directory, and yet the HTML and CSS code are enough in their evident nature to suffice the working of the craft of the project.
