## 📄 About the Project

This project is a visual recreation of the Cursor editor's user interface. The goal was to replicate the modern, dark-themed aesthetic and typography of the original application using only core web technologies.

It focuses on layout precision, flexbox/grid mechanics, and responsive design principles without relying on JavaScript frameworks.

### Key Features
* **Pure HTML/CSS:** No external frameworks or libraries.
* **Modern Layout:** Utilizes CSS Flexbox and Grid for precise alignment.
* **Custom Typography:** Matches the font weight and spacing of the original UI.
